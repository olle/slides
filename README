 INTRODUCTION
 
 Slides is a jQuery plugin that provides a very simple and fully unobtrusive
 image slideshow, with cross fading effect, to any image element on a web page.
 
 Features:

  - Unobtrusive
  - Cross fading between images
  - Configurable cross fade time
  - Adjustable pause time on each image
  - Optional linking to URL on click or custom event handler function
 
 QUICK GUIDE
 
 Usage:
 
  Any IMG element can be enabled as a slideshow using Slides. Just find your
  elements by some selector, for example an ID selector.
  
  <img src="images/someimage.jpg" id="slide" />
  
  Bind the Slides plugin to the element found by simply calling the plugin with
  your slideshow configuration passed as a JSON object.
  
  jQuery("#slide").Slides({
  	images : [image1.jpg, image2.jpg, image3.jpg]  
  });
 
 Optional settings control crossfade time, image pause, link to URL on click or
 a custom function to be used on image click.
 
  jQuery("#slide").Slides({
  	images : [image1.jpg, image2.jpg, image3.jpg],
  	 urls : [link1, link2, link3],
  	 functions : [fn1, fn2, fn3],
  	 pause : 12000, //ms 
  	 fade : 2000,
  });

 NOTE: When using the urls or functions, urls are always delegated to be handled
       before any functions, so use one OR the other.
